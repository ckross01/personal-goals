### Week in Review:
My turn to get sick so the long weekend was mostly spent in bed resting. Pomodoros keep alluding me, might need to spend
some time to figure out how to get better at those, need a way to track them. As a result of being sick didn't present at
NodeAZ, although I need to. Still playing video games too much.
