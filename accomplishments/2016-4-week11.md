### Week in Review:
I completed a goal for this year and submitted a CFP! Pretty amazing and I was really nervous.
Might or might not get selected but that's ok the goal was to just submit one.

Did not finish Dune, for some reason reading is taking a back seat. Also, not enjoying blogging
as much unless the topic is fresh in my mind. Need to work on that.

Also, can't decide what to learn just too many things to keep up on and I keep thinking if I pick
just one than I will fall behind. Need to just focus on what I like doing.
