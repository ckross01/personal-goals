### Week in Review:
Less video games this week but still illness in the family so working on getting my goals accomplished has been slow going.
On the upside I have been hitting around 10k step every day which helps with the exercise goal. Completed 4 tracked Pomodoros
this week and decided to use Pomello to track them. Need to get better at logging distractions and reading during my down time.
