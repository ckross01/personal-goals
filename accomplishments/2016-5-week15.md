### Week in Review:
Still more visitors that severly limit my free time but that's ok. I presented at
NodeAZ again, this time on Ava and refactoring an app from ES5 to ES6. It was a lot of
fun.

A note on [fear of losing a technical edge](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ask-the-cto-new-manager-has-a-fear-of-losing-a-technical-edge) article
I read. It was an excellent post, really good, can't over state how good that article is. Rereading it again this week.
