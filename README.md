Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Exercise!
2. Contribute to Node Core
3. Write more blog posts
4. Get better at JavaScript
5. Submit a CFP (never done that before)
